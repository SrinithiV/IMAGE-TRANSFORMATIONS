# IMAGE-TRANSFORMATIONS
## Aim
To perform image transformation such as Translation, Scaling, Shearing, Reflection, Rotation and Cropping using OpenCV and Python.

## Software Required:
Anaconda - Python 3.7

## Algorithm:
### Step1:
Import necessary libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib for image processing and visualization.

### Step2:
Read the input image using cv2.imread() and store it in a variable for further processing.

### Step3:
Apply various transformations like translation, scaling, shearing, reflection, rotation, and cropping by defining corresponding functions:

Translation moves the image along the x or y-axis.

Scaling resizes the image by scaling factors.

Shearing distorts the image along one axis.

Reflection flips the image horizontally or vertically.

Rotation rotates the image by a given angle.

### Step4:
Display the transformed images using Matplotlib for visualization. Convert the BGR image to RGB format to ensure proper color representation.

### Step5:
Save or display the final transformed images for analysis and use plt.show() to display them inline in Jupyter or compatible environments.
